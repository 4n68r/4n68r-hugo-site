Welcome to the new **4n68r.com**! A lot of DFIR folks have been taking on the [Zeltser 
Challenge](https://zeltser.com/2010-retrospective-on-my-security-blog/) lately, no doubt
spurred on by recent attendance of the DFIR <del>Zoo</del> Summit in Austin, TX. Back in
June 2016, I even switched my blog platform following the DFIR Summit and started blogging
over [at Medium](https://medium.com/@4n68r/). Back then, [I wrote](https://medium.com/@4n68r/2016-dfir-summit-d3bf51a94974):

>The mobile panel encouraged folks in the #DFIR community to blog more, and while I have a blog, I don’t post much on it because I get bogged down in the technical details. I recently moved away from WordPress due to security concerns and set up a static site via GitHub Pages, but I miss the features of a CMS. Granted, there’s Jekyll, but I hate Ruby and then I have to generate static pages and push them up to GitHub. I’m looking for an “easy button” for blogging (but *not* for forensics!).

>This is my first post on Medium, so we’ll see how this goes. My main concerns so far will be posting code and having the freedom to inject HTML when I wish to do so. Those limitations may cause me to leave Medium, but I want to give it a shot first and see how it goes. So far, it’s definitely easy.

Medium served me alright for a couple of years, but I enjoy

- the freedom of having my own domain and complete control over my content,
- having a static site for security purposes,
- being able to compose primarily in Markdown (but able to inject HTML whenever I want to), and
- simplicity.

It looks like I can finally have a static site generator that affords me all of the above
thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It lets me do what I want and makes it easy to do
so. I'm also deploying this via GitHub Pages, so that simplifies hosting as well.

**I'm *not* going to be taking on the Zeltser challenge**&mdash;I have far too much going 
on in life. But I *am* going to continue sharing with the DFIR community through 
<a href="/speaking/">speaking/teaching</a>, <a href="/projects/">sharing code</a>, and 
documenting things I learn along the way: whether through <a href="/blog/">blogging</a> or 
via <a href="https://github.com/danzek/annotationis">my *annotationis* repo</a>.
